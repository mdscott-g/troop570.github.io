Boy Scout Troop 570 invites you to be come a member of our Troop. As a member
of our Troop you will enjoy new experiences, make new friends and have fun.
You will also learn new skills while advancing in rank.

#### Visit Us

The best way to learn about Troop 570 is to visit us at one of our troop
meetings. Visiting boys can join a patrol for the evening, learn about how our
meetings work, and play games with us. Visiting parents can meet with an adult
leader to ask questions about our troop. Contact our troop committee
chairperson Paul Schindler at

to arrange a date to visit.

We meet at 7 PM on Monday evenings at the Holy Spirit Lutheran Church in Kirkland

Troop meetings are usually the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Mondays of each month with a
boy leadership meeting on the 4th Monday.

We have a monthly parent meeting on the second Monday of every month.

#### Outdoor Program

The saying goes that “three quarters of Scouting is outing”, and the Troop
schedules at least one outing per month year around. We hike, car camp,
backpack, snowshoe, and attend District events with other troops like Camporee,
Merit Badge Weekend and Klondike. In the summer, we go to summer camp for a
week and on one or more multi-day high-adventure trips. These outings will be
some of the best times you will ever have. 

We [went on many fun outings in 2014](/outings/) and have more planned for
2015.

#### Boy Run

Troop 570 prides itself in being a boy run troop. Our outings and weekly
meetings are planned and conducted by the boys.

#### Who can join

A boy must meet the Boy Scouts of America age requirement: Be a boy who is 11
years old, or one who has completed the fifth grade or earned the Arrow of
Light Award and is at least 10 years old, but is not yet 18 years old.

Boys can join Troop 570 any time during the year. No previous scouting
experience is required.

Troop 570 welcomes boys of all religious beliefs.
