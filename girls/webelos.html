      Camp Pigott<br>November 10-11 2018
    </p>
    <p>
    Troop 570 Girls Founding Team is joint-hosting a one-night car camping trip at
    <a href="https://www.seattlebsa.org/camp-pigott">Camp
    Pigott</a> with Troop 570 Boy Scouts.– a Boy Scout Camp.
    </p>
    
    <p>All girls are invited to come along and join us for our first ever outreach
    campout. We have many activities planned for the weekend. We will be practicing
    scout skills that might include fire building, knife and axe safety, knot
    tying, cooking, pioneering and orienteering – plus maybe a few surprises.  We
    will make time for some group games too. </p>
    
    <p>On Saturday evening, Troop 570 will cook dinner for you.  Afterwards, there
    is going to be an evening campfire program with skits, songs and stories.
    Webelos are encouraged to participate by adding their own skits, songs or
    run-ons. 
    </p>
    
    <p>We hope you will join us!</p>

    <h4>Travel</h4>

    <p>Meet at the north end of the Kingsgate Park &amp; Ride at 10:00 AM on
    Saturday, November 10th. Plan on leaving the parking lot promptly by 10:30 AM
    when all have arrived.</p>
    
    <p>The drive to Camp Pigott is approximately 45 minutes from Kirkland <a
    href="https://www.seattlebsa.org/images/council/camping/Camp_Pigott_Directions.pdf">(map)</a>.
    If you need help with driving, let us know. 
    We will assume your group is handling your own transportation unless you tell
    us otherwise.</p>
    
    <p>Troop 570 will meet you in the parking lot at Camp Pigott to help you get
    your gear to our camping area. </p>
    
    <p>We plan to return to the Kingsgate Park &amp; Ride at (or around) 1:00 pm on Sunday,
    November 11th.</p>

    <h4>Meals</h4>

    <p>Bring your own "sack" lunch for Saturday, Sunday breakfast and any snacks
    that you might want. We will have hot water available at all times for you to
    make your own beverages.
     
    <p>Troop 570 will cook Saturday dinner! Adults are encouraged to visit with us
    as we prepare the evening meal. We charge $5 per person to cover the cost of
    the dinner.
    
    <p>Everyone should have extra food for themselves in case of emergency (extra
    food is one of the Scout Basic essentials).

    <h4>Gear</h4>

    <p>Bring your Webelos handbook as you will have the chance to work on some
    activity badge requirements.
    
    <p>Prepare as you would for outdoor overnight Fall outing.  The standard BSA
    Webelos Scout Overnight Checklist in the Cub Scout Leaders Book (page 34-50) is
    a good one to use.  You can also <a
    href="http://www.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/34-50.pdf">download the checklist
    from scouting.org</a>.
    
    <p>Bring a tent if you have one or let us know if you want to borrow a tent
    when you RSVP.
    
    <p>Coordinate whatever group equipment you might need including but not limited
    to: Tents with poles, stakes, ground cloths and lines, dining fly (in case of
    liquid sunshine), cooking/cleaning kits, stoves. If you feel you are lacking
    any other gear, please contact us as our Troop probably has it and would be
    happy to let you borrow it for the weekend.
    
    <p>You are encouraged to put together a skit, song or run-on for the Saturday
    evening campfire program. Make sure you bring any props you might need for it.

        <b>Please RSVP</b> – If at all possible, please let the Adult Leader below
        know by Sunday evening, October 28th of your intentions so we can better plan
        for the weekend.  Let us know how many total people you will be bringing up,
        Webelos and adults. There is limited space and we need to make sure everyone
        is accommodated.
