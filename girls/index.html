<h3 class="text-center">Our Troop</h3>
<p>Girl Troop 570 begins on February 1st, 2019, and is chartered by the Holy
Spirit Lutheran Church in Kirkland, WA. The church also charters a Boy Scout
troop, established in 1969, a Cub Scout Pack and a Venture Crew.</p>

<p>Our troop has a founding team of nine girls and looks forward to new members
joining in February.  We meet on the same nights and times in the church as the
boy scout troop, but in different rooms. The boy and girl troops will operate
independently – different meetings, programs, outings and Senior Patrol
Council.</p>

<p>We invite Webelos and Scouting-age girls (11 to 17 years old) and
their parents to visit us. Contact us at  <a href="mailto:troop570girls@outlook.com">troop570girls@outlook.com</a> to arrange a
visit.
