#### Outdoor Program

The saying goes that &ldquo;three quarters of Scouting is outing,&rdquo; and the Troop
schedules at least one outing per month year around. We hike, car camp,
backpack, snowshoe, and attend events with other troops in the
[Sammamish Trail District](http://www.seattlebsa.org/Sammamish-Trails){:target="_blank"},
events like Camporee, Merit Badge Weekend and Klondike.
In the summer, we go to a week long summer camp and on one
or more multi-day high-adventure trips. These outings will be
some of the best times you will ever have.

We [went on many fun outings in 2014](/outings/) and have many more planned for
2015.
