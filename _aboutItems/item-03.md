#### Outdoor Program

We go on many great outings every year!  Day hikes and day outings, simple car
camping at established camp sites, backpacking trips for beginners and trips
for more advanced challenges, high-adventure week-long outings to challenge
those who are ready to take them on, and opportunities to give back to our
community by way of service projects every year.
