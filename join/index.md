#### Meetings (except as noted in the Troop Calendar)

- 7:00 PM in the upper fellowship hall at Holy Spirit Lutheran Church ([map](http://goo.gl/OGwdzP)).
- Troop Meetings are usually the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Mondays of each month
- Patrol Leader’s Council meeting is on the 4th Monday
- Patrol Meetings at the discretion of the Patrol Leader
- Courts of Honor twice a year, usually in April and October (all parents should attend)
- Monthly Parent meetings on the 2nd Monday of every month. Only registered Committee members can vote, if one is called for during a meeting. All parents are encouraged to attend.

#### Scout Participation

Boys cannot receive the benefits of the Boy Scout program unless they actively
participate in Troop meetings and the outdoor program. We understand that
homework, sports, church activities, or other commitments will sometimes cause
a Scout to miss meetings or activities, but regular participation should be
encouraged and aided by the parent. Rank advancement to First Class requires
participation in at least ten troop activities (other than Troop meetings),
three of which must be overnight campouts.

#### Outdoor Program

The saying goes “three quarters of Scouting is outing”, and the Troop schedules
at least one outing per month year around. We hike, car camp, backpack,
snowshoe, and attend District events with other Troops like Camporee, Merit
Badge Weekend and Klondike. These outings will be some of the best times you
will ever have.

#### New Scouts

We're always happy to let visiting cub scouts come to our meetings. You'll get
to join a patrol for the evening, learn about how our meetings work, and play
games with us. The only time you would not want to come to a meeting is on the
day of the Patrol Leaders Council, which is the 4th Monday of each month, and
is not a normal troop meeting.
