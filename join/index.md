#### Visit Us

The best way to learn about Troop 570 is to visit us at one of our troop
meetings. Visiting boys can join a patrol for evening, learn about how our
meetings work, and play games with us. Visiting parents can meet with an adult
leader to ask questions about our troop. Contact our troop committee
chairperson Paul Schindler
([paschind@outlook.com](mailto:paschind@outlook.com)) to arrange a date to
visit.

#### Meetings

We meet at 7 PM on Monday evenings at the Holy Spirit Lutheran Church
([map](http://goo.gl/OGwdzP)). Troop meetings are usually the 1st, 2nd and 3rd
Mondays of each month with a boy leadership meeting on the 4th Monday.

We have a monthly parent meeting on the second Monday of every month.

#### Outdoor Program

The saying goes that “three quarters of Scouting is outing”, and the Troop
schedules at least one outing per month year around. We hike, car camp,
backpack, snowshoe, and attend District events with other troops like Camporee,
Merit Badge Weekend and Klondike. In the summer, we go to summer camp for a
week and on one or more multi-day high-adventure trips. These outings will be
some of the best times you will ever have.

#### Scout Run

Troop 570 prides itself in being a Scout run troop. Our outings and weekly
meetings are planned and conducted by the scouts.

#### Who can join

Boy Scouts is available to boys from age 11 through age 17. Boys who have
earned the Arrow of Light Award (in Cub Scouts) and are at least 10 years old
and boys who have completed the fifth grade and are at least 10 can also join
Boy Scouts.

Boys can join Troop 570 any time during the year. No previous scouting
experience is required.

Troop 570 welcomes boys of all religious beliefs.
