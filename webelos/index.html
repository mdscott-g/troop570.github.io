<p class="lead">
Camp Pigott<br>November 7-8, 2015
</p>

<p>
The outdoors is calling you – let’s go camping!! 
Camping is living outdoors. 
So when you go camping, you need skills that will help you feel at home in the outdoors. 
When you bridge over to a Boy Scout troop, you’ll probably be outdoors a lot more often. 
So why not join a Boy Scout troop on a camping trip and learn what THEY do? 
Troop 570 is planning a program that they hope Webelos will enjoy and one where they might even learn a few things while they are at it! 
Things like some of the Outdoorsman Activity Badge requirements call for the boys to participate in a Boy Scout outing -- so here is your chance! 
Have fun while Fall camping at Chief Seattle Council’s own <a href-"http://seattlebsa.org/Main-Website-Content/Camp-Pigott">Camp Pigott</a> with Troop 570!
</p>

<h4>Travel</h4>

<p>Meet at the Juanita High School parking lot at 9:30 AM on Saturday, November 7th.  
Plan on leaving the parking lot promptly by 10:00 AM when all have arrived.

<p>The drive to Camp Pigott is approximately 45 minutes from Kirkland <a href="http://www.seattlebsa.org/media/camping/CampPigottDirections.pdf">(map)</a>. 
If you need help with driving, let us know. 
We will assume your group is handling your own transportation unless you tell us otherwise.

<p>Troop 570 will meet you in the parking lot at Camp Pigott to help you get your gear to our camping area. 

<p>We plan to return to Juanita High School at (or around) 1:00 pm on Sunday, November 8th.</dd>

<h4>Meals</h4>

<p>Bring your own "sack" lunch for Saturday, Sunday breakfast and any snacks
that you might want. 

<p>Troop 570 will cook Saturday dinner! Adults are encouraged to visit with us as we prepare the
evening meal. We charge $5 per person to cover the cost of the dinner.

<p>Everyone should have extra food for themselves in case of emergency (extra food is one of the 10
essentials).

<h4>Gear</h4>

<p>Bring your Webelos handbook as you will have the chance to work on some activity badge
requirements.

<p>Prepare as you would for outdoor overnight Fall outing. 
The standard BSA Webelos Scout Overnight Checklist in the Cub Scout Leaders Book (page 34-50) is a good one to use. 
You can also <a href="http://www.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/34-50.pdf">download the checklist from scouting.org</a>.

<p>Bring a tent. We will have some Adirondacks shelters for our visiting Webelos, but
the total number of beds is limited. They will be given in a first come, first
served basis. If we run out of space in these, you will need to have a tent.

<p>Coordinate whatever group equipment you might need including but not limited to: Tents with poles, stakes, ground cloths and lines, dining fly (in case of liquid sunshine), cooking/cleaning kits, stoves. If you feel you are lacking any other gear, please contact us as our Troop probably has it and would be happy to let you borrow it for the weekend.

<p>You are encouraged to put together a skit, song or run-on for the Saturday evening campfire program. Make sure you bring any props you might need for it.

<p>We have reserved camp sites for our event. Please download the camp map from our web site so that youa re familiar with the camp site locations.

<div class="well">
  <b>Please RSVP</b> – If at all possible, please let the Adult Leader below know by Sunday evening, November 1st of your intentions so we can better plan for the weekend. 
  Let us know how many total people you will be bringing up, Webelos and adults. 
  There is limited space and we need to make sure everyone is accommodated.
