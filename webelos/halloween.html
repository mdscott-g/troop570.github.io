  <h3 class="text-center">Hello Webelos and Arrow of Light Den/Pack Leaders and Parents</h3>
  <p>
    Fourth and fifth grade boys and girls are invited to our ghoulishly fun Halloween Orienteering Event 
    at St. Edwards State Park (note location has changed) on Monday, October 18th from 6:30-8:15pm. 
    Model after Cascade Orienteering Club's annual Vampire-O, this is a giant field game, where participants 
    need to find as many checkpoints as possible without being bitten by the vampires that roam the land. 
    It's a combo of Treasure Quest and a Game of Tag or Capture The Flag. We will form groups of 2 or 3 and 
    the game will be about 45 minutes.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Bring a flashlight or headlamp, compass (if you have one) and a whistle. Dress appropriately for the weather. 
    There will be a photo booth and flashing trinkets. Costume is optional. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Check-in is 6:30pm at the picnic tables behind St. Edwards seminary's gymnasium. 
    <strong>There is no parking at St. Edwards after dusk. Please park vehicles at Arrowhead Elementary and walk to the park.</strong> 
    We will walk back together as a group to Arrowhead Elementary after the event.
